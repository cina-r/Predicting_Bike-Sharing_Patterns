# Predicting_Bike-Sharing_Patterns
This is the first project of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.  

## Problem statement
As a bike sharing company, you want to predict the number of bikes you need. If you have too few you're losing money from potential customers and if you have too many you are wasting money (storage, maintenance etc.) for unused bikes.

## Solution
Historical rental and weather data on hourly basis is split into a train and a test set. The former one is used to train a simple neural network with one hidden layer consisting of 10 nodes.  
  
The following image shows the prediction on a test set of 21 days:
